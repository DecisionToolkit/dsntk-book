# Overview

**Decision Toolkit** (or shortly **DSNTK**) is a suite of tools designed to evaluate, build and test decision models.
DSNTK is constructed based on the [Decision Model and Notation (DMN™)](https://www.omg.org/dmn/) specification,
which is an industry standard governed by the [Object Management Group (OMG®)](https://www.omg.org/).

DSNTK aims to be performant, reliable, and fully compliant with the [DMN™](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN) specification,
ensuring accurate evaluation of decision models. All tools are implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
a programming language known for its security, efficiency and reliability.

DSNTK offers a range of features, including DMN model evaluation, decision table evaluation, and FEEL expression evaluation.
It also includes functionality for parsing, validating, and recognizing DMN models, decision tables, and FEEL expressions.
Users can test DMN models, decision tables, and FEEL expressions, and export them to HTML format.

DSNTK provides a comprehensive set of tools for decision model evaluation and testing,
leveraging the [DMN™](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN) specification and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language
to ensure high performance, reliability and portability.

## Project status

Please note that although DSNTK is **production ready**, there are still some features 
that may be subject to change or refinement, based on testing and user feedback.
We welcome users to try DSNTK out and provide feedback or suggestions
to improve its usability or performance.
