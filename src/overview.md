# Overview

^dt (or shortly ^dsntk) is a suite of tools designed to build, evaluate and test decision models.

^dsntk is constructed based on the [Decision Model and Notation (DMN™)](https://www.omg.org/dmn/) specification,
which is an industry standard governed by the [Object Management Group (OMG®)](https://www.omg.org/).

^dsntk aims to be performant, reliable, and fully compliant with the ^dmn specification,
ensuring accurate evaluation of decision models. All tools are implemented in ^rust,
a programming language known for its security, efficiency and reliability.

^dsntk offers a range of features, including ^dmn model evaluation, decision table evaluation, and FEEL expression evaluation.
It also includes functionality for parsing, validating, and recognizing ^dmn models, decision tables, and FEEL expressions.
Users can test ^dmn models, decision tables, and FEEL expressions, and export them to HTML format.

^dsntk provides a comprehensive set of tools for decision model evaluation and testing,
leveraging the [DMN™](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN) specification and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language
to ensure high performance, reliability and portability.

## Project status

^dsntk is **production ready**, but there are still some features that may be subject to change or refinement,
based on testing and user feedback. We welcome users to try ^dsntk out and provide feedback or suggestions
to improve its usability or performance.
